/**
 * Exercise 8 - Pizza Party
 * Division isn’t always exact, and sometimes you’ll write programs that will need to deal with the leftovers as a whole number instead of a decimal.
 *
 * Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the number of people, the number of pizzas, and the number of slices per pizza.
 * Ensure that the number of pieces comes out even. Display the number of pieces of pizza each person should get. If there are leftovers, show the number of leftover pieces.
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * How many people? 8
 * How many pizzas do you have? 2
 * How many slices per pizza? 8
 * 8 people with 2 pizzas (16 slices)
 * Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
 * There are 0 leftover pieces.
 *
 * Challenges
 *
 * Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
 * Alter the output so it handles pluralization properly, for example: "Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza." or "Each person gets 1 piece of pizza."
 * Handle the output for leftover pieces appropriately as well.
 * Create a variant of the program that prompts for the number of people and the number of pieces each person wants, and calculate how many full pizzas you need to purchase.
